# GodotTracy

> [Tracy Profiler](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) is a [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) module that can be used to profile C++ and scripting at the same time, so to have good insight about what your game is really doing to take the correct actions to heal your game performance.

This is a fork of [AndreaCatania](https://github.com/AndreaCatania/godot_tracy)'s repo.

I have stripped the readme, please see upstream for instructions.

I have a [branch]([https://github.com/enetheru/godot_tracy/issues/1](https://github.com/enetheru/godot/tree/4.3-tracy)) with my changes to godot if you want to trace from within the engine.
